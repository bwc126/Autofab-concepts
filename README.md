# Autofab-concepts
Conceptual development and modeling of an automatic fabricator based on contemporary technology

*current status: very early development*

## Chemical Processing (ChPU)
Uses modular microfluidic components to process chemicals from simple inputs.

## Materials Processing (MPU)
Uses a combination of micro-extrusion, electrojetting, and electroplating to fabricate components with material from the chemical processing system.

## Convergent Assembly (CAU)
Uses diamagnetically actuated microdrones to assemble the fabricated components, along with pre-fabricated off-the-shelf components if necessary, into more complex finished products.

*Necessary for next stage: (early development)*

ChPU:
-Distillation, chromatographic column separator modules
-Repeating unit configuration (l1 cache -> sep./cat./merge/mix/xchange/l1,l2 cache)

MPU:
-electroplater model
-electrojet emitters enlarged for wiring
-material distribution in line with ChPU standards

CAU:
-CAU II interior
-Align electronics with known constraints

Assembly:
-At least one complete assembly of each kind and scale up to CAU II
